This is mostly necessary for things not handled by Cask (which we'll see later down the line)

(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
#+end_src

** Emacs changes from customization system
I don't want these changes anywhere near this file.
Mostly I use them for the local default font settings.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file
      (concat stag-init-dir "/init-custom.el"))
#+end_src
